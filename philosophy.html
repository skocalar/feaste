                        <h3>Perspective: Chemical synthesis without assembly manuals</h3>
                    </div>

                                To the average person, assembling furniture is a challenge. No matter how many schematics the assembly manual contains, putting together that IKEA bookshelf is still far from a smooth experience. Nonetheless, I personally don’t mind this process. What typically confuses and frustrates others—jumping between pages in an effort to identify the skipped-over step and suspecting the kit of missing a piece—is instead an exhilarating adventure to me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Taking up the challenge of assembling furniture creates an opportunity for discovery. Through discovery, the temporary feelings of confusion and uncertainty amass into excitement and zeal. Something that has never existed in the household before has finally been created.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I gaze at the NMR: the large intimidating instrument gently holding my sample of chemicals, applying a large magnetic field, and taking its time to produce the data that will inform me of whether I’ve finally arrived at the compound I’ve been striving to make for the past five months. Seconds are elongated into minutes. The suspense nags at me. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Flash. A spectrum appears. In an instant, my body stiffens and my eyes hurry across the pixelated screen as I try to make sense of the peaks I see. Everything is wonderful. Success is an arm’s length away. Until I notice two odd peaks. Two odd, conspicuous peaks attempting to camouflage into what could have been a perfect spectrum. What should have been two singlets was instead two doublets. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am uncertain. My nonexistent assembly manual didn’t warn me of this. Have I screwed together the wrong two planks of wood? Have I misplaced my screwdriver? What might my chemical compound be? At this point I must create my own manual. I run computational studies and set up additional reactions. I perform reaction kinetics experiments and characterize my product in multiple ways. I find myself face to face with novel molecular scaffolds that have never been synthesized on the face of Earth before.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After weeks of experimentation, I have narrowed down the possibilities. I have one leading hypothesis, as well as an experiment design idea that could give me key insight into the possibility of that hypothesis being a reality. And then I am told, “You <i>could</i> do that, but instead, I was thinking you could do this.” I am shut down. But I am also conflicted. If I never try my experiment, I will never know if it could have worked. A missed opportunity for discovery. I leave behind any hesitation and strut toward my fumehood, where I pick up my micropipette and begin concentrating. If anyone asks what I’m working on, they will not hear the truth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, my experiment yields negative results. But I do not consider it a failure; I am simply redirected. Redirected to another page in the manual. In fact, my experiment still provides me with insight and before long, I am able to prove my leading hypothesis in multiple ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have finally synthesized my compound. A compound that has never been synthesized by any other chemist. I have discovered a piece of knowledge that no one else has ever known. I have made a discovery. Despite the challenging and tumultuous process, the feelings of confusion did not repel me. I was invigorated by those feelings. Ultimately, I learned that whether I’m assembling molecules or furniture, discovery and innovation both begin in a state of uncertainty, from which studies evolve to produce fruitful results.

                                Research is an endeavor into uncertainty with the ultimate goal of uncovering truth. Truth can’t always be uncovered, however, in which theories supported by evidence are devised. Although not all truths are absolute, the truths within synthetic chemistry are relatively less subjective, especially compared to other sciences, like political science or social science. As researchers, we are in pursuit of this absolute truth and even when we do believe we have reached that point, we may be proven wrong, not because the truth doesn’t exist but because we still have yet to fully uncover it; truth isn’t easily knowable. Research is a field in which we are not completely diving head first into an unknown wilderness, but rather we are building upon previous discoveries of what is believed to be true. Research is collaborative because we use our observations and hypotheses, with the support of and justification by previously-reported truths, and test their validity to either corroborate them or to prove previous beliefs false.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, it is impossible to have absolute proof while physically doing research. Researchers must commit to certain presuppositions, assuming that experimental procedure, once carried out, will perfectly accomplish the intended goal without yielding any systematic error. Ultimately, the purpose of this endeavor is to uncover truths that further improve the quality of human life and the environment and give us better knowledge of the world we are living in. Even when we are unable to uncover the truth that helps enable us to attain these visions, theories that make us think in another perspective about the world also serve the same purpose.

                                Baran. Wender. Kuwajima. All are leaders in the realm of natural product synthesis. Holton. Nicolau. Mukaiyama. But rarely are these names that come to our minds ever female. Chemistry is seen as a dangerous, difficult field. Thus, it requires scientists who are capable, tough, strong-minded, and persistent. Why is it that men are always perceived to be better suited for this field than women are?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a high school female, I sometimes find it difficult to imagine a woman leading their lab in the way that men do. The female species' stereotype of delicacy and gentleness almost seems to correlate to less significant, less frequent, less impactful results. But this is merely a false perception in a field that has been male-dominated for years. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, being more careful or perfectionist about one’s work does not define the work ethic of that researcher or the significance of their research. There seems to be the stigma that women are more motherly about their compounds and take unnecessarily longer to produce the same results that a man could produce in a much shorter amount of time. One day while in lab, my research advisor brought up his observation that women always take longer to run columns when purifying their compounds. While it was merely an observation on his end, I felt offended by his statement. Gender does not define the efficiency nor success of one’s work and it certainly doesn’t hold them back from surpassing others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first step to creating greater diversity in organic chemistry is to acknowledge the female chemists who are actively researching in this field. Marisa Kozlowski, Gunda Georg, Janine Cossy, and Allison Frontier are some that come to mind. By increasing the number of female chemist role models, we can inspire the next generation of aspiring scientists and work toward convergence in this field.
